To the Professor/TA grading this,

The .ipynb should be clearly labeled here, under the name: InfoVis_FinalVersion.ipynb

Because of a complicated error with the packabe nbformat, responsible for the interactive elements in graph,
There are occasionally problems when running the notebook,
Some of the graphs will print a whitespace, or not print at all
Luckily, this can easily be resolved by either running the notebook again,
Or, a better solution is to simply run the individual cell again.
We understand this is frustrating, and we sincerely apologize,
but this bug seems fairly irregular, and beyond our control.
